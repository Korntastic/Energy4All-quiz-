# Instruction: To run the program you should download all the files and double click on the python file(make sure it is in the same folder with the csv and the assets folder) to run it.
# The python file is the main backbone of this program that includes all the logic.

# The assets folder contains all the images and audio used in the program.

# The CSV file contains all questions, options, answers, tips that are loaded into the python file. It is there to seperate the data from the program, making it easier to update any cell or add new rows.
